A website where you can check download counts for GitHub releases, along with information like release author and date of publishing.

# Building from repository
- Clone the repository
- Run `npm install`
- Scripts: 
  * Run on localhost: `npm run serve`
  * Build for production: `npm run build`   

# Using the Website
Go to <a href="https://github-stats1.web.app" title="GithubStats">Stats for GitHub</a> and type in the name of the the organisation/ repo owner, and a repository with releases. 
  
Once you submit it, you'll see a list of all the releases, the total download count of all releases and the download count of each release. 
  
The latest versions are highlighted in `green`, and pre-releases are marked in `yellow`.
